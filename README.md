Solar energy technology has evolved to compete with conventional sources of electricity generation. A key ingredient of this area is to know how much energy is going to be produced using Data Analytics techniques.
The hardware system connected to the solar panel and computer measures Voltage, Current and Power from the solar panel. The data coming out from the sensor is stored in the database and the model is buid using Linear Regression.
The app will fetch the weather data from visual crossing web services API for the selected date range and location. And the app predicts the power generation for the selected time period.
